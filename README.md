# machine-learning-course

This code is part of my machine learning course and is divided in several packages (one per lesson).


# The 'data' directory
I will update it from time to time as long as I get samples.
You need to add the data to each package you use to follow along (first one doesn't require it).
The data you download is in raw form but is automatically processed when you install a package.

# Installing a package

1. Open the terminal and go to the package package you want to use.
For example: cd data_collection_lesson_package

2. Go inside the node directory within that package.
Command: cd node

3. Install the package:
Command: npm install

# Tools

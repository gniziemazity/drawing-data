# Drawing data used in my machine learning course
Course Link: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB0Tybl0UNfYe9aJXfWw-Dw_4VnFrqRC4

I will update this data from time to time:
<br>
First Update: 6.12.2022, when I recorded Phase 1 of the course
<br>
Last Update: 15.5.2023, when I recorded Phase 2 of the course
<br><br>
You need to add the data to each package you use to follow along (P1 doesn't need it):

<br>

<br><br>
The data you download here is in raw form and will be automatically processed when you install a package.

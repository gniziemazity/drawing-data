# Drawing data used in my machine learning course

I will update this data from time to time [Last Update: 6.12.2022, when I recorded Phase 1 of the course]

You need to add the data to each package you use to follow along (P1 doesn't need it).:

The data you download here is in raw form and will be automatically processed when you install a package.
